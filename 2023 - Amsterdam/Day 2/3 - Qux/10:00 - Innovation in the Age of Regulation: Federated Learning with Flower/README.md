## Abstract
With the rise of data privacy concerns around AI in the EU, how can we innovate using AI capabilities despite regulations around consumer data? What tools and features are available to help us build AI in regulated industries? This talk will discuss how we can leverage diverse datasets to build better AI models without ever having to touch the datasets by using a Python library called Flower.
