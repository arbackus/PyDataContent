## Abstract
Survival analysis was initially introduced to handle the data analysis required in use cases revolving death and treatment in health care. Due to its merit, this method has spread to many other domains for analyzing and modeling the data where the outcome is the time until an event of interest occurs. Domains such as finance, economy, sociology and engineering. 

This talk aims at unraveling the potential of survival analysis with examples from different domains. A taxonomy of the existing descriptive and predictive analytics algorithms in survival analysis are demonstrated. The concept of some candidate algorithms from each group are explained in detail, along with an example and implementation guideline using the right open source framework.
