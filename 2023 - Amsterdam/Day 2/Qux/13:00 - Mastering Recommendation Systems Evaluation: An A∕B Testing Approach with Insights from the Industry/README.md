## Abstract
Recommendation systems shape personalized experiences across various sectors, but evaluating their effectiveness remains a significant challenge. Drawing on experiences from industry leaders such as Booking.com, this talk introduces a robust, practical approach to A/B testing for assessing the quality of recommendation systems. The talk is designed for data scientists, statisticians, and business professionals, offering real-world insights and industry tricks on setting up A/B tests, interpreting results, and circumventing common pitfalls. While basic familiarity with recommendation systems and A/B testing is beneficial, it's not a prerequisite.
