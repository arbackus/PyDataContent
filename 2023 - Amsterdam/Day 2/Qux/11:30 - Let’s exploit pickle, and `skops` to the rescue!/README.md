## Abstract
Pickle files can be evil and simply loading them can run arbitrary code on your system. This talk presents why that is, how it can be exploited, and how `skops` is tackling the issue for scikit-learn/statistical ML models. We go through some lower level pickle related machinery, and go in detail how the new format works.
