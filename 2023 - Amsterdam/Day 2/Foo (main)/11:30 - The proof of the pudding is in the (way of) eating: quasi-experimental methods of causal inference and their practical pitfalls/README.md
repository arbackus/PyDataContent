## Abstract
Data scientists and analysts are using quasi-experimental methods to make recommendations based on causality instead of randomized control trials. While these methods are easy to use, their assumptions can be complex to explain. This talk will explain these assumptions for data scientists and analysts without in-depth training of causal inference so they can use and explain these methods more confidently to change people's minds using data.
