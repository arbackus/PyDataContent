## Abstract
Feature Stores are a vital part of the MLOps stack for managing machine learning features and ensuring data consistency. This talk introduces Feature Stores and the underlying data management architecture. We’ll then discuss the challenges and learnings of integrating DuckDB and Arrow Flight into the our Feature Store platform, and share benchmarks showing up to 30x speedups compared to Spark/Hive. Discover how DuckDB and ArrowFlight can also speedup your data management and machine learning pipelines.
