## Abstract
ChatGPT is a fantastic assistant, but it cannot do everything yet. For example, it cannot automatically manage my calendar, update my to-do list, or do anything that requires it to perform actions. However, what would it take to make this a reality? I decided to put it to the test by allowing ChatGPT to manage my to-do list for me.

During this presentation, I will tell how I gave ChatGPT access to my to-do list. Along the way, I will introduce you to the concepts behind LLM-based agents and how they work. Of course, I will also give a demo of the final result. After this demo, we will dive into clever engineering solutions and tricks I discovered to solve problems such as handling hallucinations, parsing actions, etc.

This talk is for people who want to learn how to build their first LLM-based agent. Familiarity with Python, PyDantic, and LMMs is nice during this presentation but not essential. As long as you love overengineered solutions to a basic to-do list, you will like this presentation.
