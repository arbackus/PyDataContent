## Abstract
Data science, IT and software development become more and more complex and are subject to increasing requirements and fast-paced business demand. Higher complexity, higher pace and higher quality requirements result in more pressure on our fellow data engineers and data scientists. 

More pressure, but are we resilient enough to withstand that increasing pressure? You have probably already seen its outcome. Unhappiness, stress or even burn-outs of co-workers, instead of creating cool code, great solutions and building a better world using your skills.

How to change the pressure and stress you perceive as a data scientist, data engineer of ML-engineer? How to ensure that your brain’s frontal lobe returns to a problem solving and decision-making state?
