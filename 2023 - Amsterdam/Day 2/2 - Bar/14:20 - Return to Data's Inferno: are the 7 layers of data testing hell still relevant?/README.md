## Abstract
Back in 2018, a blogpost titled "Data's Inferno: 7 circles of data testing hell with Airflow" presented a layered approach to data quality checks in data applications and pipelines. Now, 5 years later, this talk looks back at Data's Inferno and surveys what has changed but also what hasn't in the space of ensuring high data quality.
