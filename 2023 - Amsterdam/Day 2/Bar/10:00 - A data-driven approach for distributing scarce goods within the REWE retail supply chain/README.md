## Abstract
Global political circumstances and unpredictable crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic can cause a scarcity of grocery goods within the retail supply chain. We present a data-driven approach to ensure a fair and replicable distribution from the supplier to the retail warehouses at REWE, one of the largest grocery chains in Germany.
