## Abstract
This talk delves into the topic of minimizing the Data Mesh mess. We will explore practical strategies and a data platform architecture for effectively governing and managing data within a decentralized data setup. We can balance decentralization and maintaining data quality by imposing a few constraints. The takeaways of this talk are drawn from the data platform at Enza Zaden.
