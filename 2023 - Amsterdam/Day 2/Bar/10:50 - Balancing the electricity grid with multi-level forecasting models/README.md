## Abstract
Join us as we explore the complexities of balancing the electricity grid amidst the rise of renewable energy sources. Weâ€™ll discover the challenges in forecasting electricity consumption from diverse industrial resources and the modelling techniques employed by Sympower to achieve accurate forecasts. Gain insights into the trade-offs involved in aggregating data at different hierarchical levels in time series forecasting.
