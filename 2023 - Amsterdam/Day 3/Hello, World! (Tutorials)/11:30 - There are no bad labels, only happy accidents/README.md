## Abstract
Are you 100% sure that you can trust your labels?
Imagine spending a company credit card worth of compute on getting the best model statistics ever. Would that be money well spent if your dataset has some labeling issues?
More often than not, "bad labels" are great because they can tell you how to improve the machine learning model before even training it. But it only works only if you actually spend the time being confronted with your own dataset. In this workshop, we'll annotate our own data while we leverage techniques to find happy accidents. To solve specific problems, you don't need loads of data anymore â€“ you just need good data.
