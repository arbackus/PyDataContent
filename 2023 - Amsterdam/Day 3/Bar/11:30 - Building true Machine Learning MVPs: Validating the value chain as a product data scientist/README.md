## Abstract
Some say machine learning projects fail because they live in notebooks. 

But I would bet that even more of them fail because their projects solve a problem that doesn’t exist. Or uses an interface that’s not feasible. In other words, they fail because they don’t validate their underlying assumptions. 

Product analytics helps build models that solve real problems. In my time at ING, I’ve been dealing with a lot of the latter, and I’ll be sharing my thoughts on how to find problems worth solving with data science.
