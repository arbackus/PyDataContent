## Abstract
In the Netherlands a large share of energy is used by industry. By measuring the energy usage of individual machines in real time it is possible to pinpoint when machines are operating inefficiently and help factories take measures to reduce energy waste. It turns out that in most factories, the biggest source of energy waste comes from idling machines. To be able to give valuable insights and provide relevant alerts to our customers, we set up a machine learning system for standby detection with a “human in the loop”. In this talk we will go over the considerations that go into setting up a machine learning system with a human in the loop and showcase our approach to the problem. No background knowledge is required for this talk.
