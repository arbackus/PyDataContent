## Abstract
Last year, the pandas community adopted a new process for making significant changes to the library: the Pandas Enhancement Proposals, aka PDEPs. In the meantime, several of those proposals have been proposed and discussed, and some already accepted. This talk will give an overview of some of the behavioural changes you can expect as a pandas user.
