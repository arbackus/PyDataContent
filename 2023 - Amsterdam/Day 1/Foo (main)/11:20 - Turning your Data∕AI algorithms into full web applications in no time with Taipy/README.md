## Abstract
Numerous packages exist within the Python open-source ecosystem for algorithm building and data visualization. However, a significant challenge persists, with over 85% of Data Science Pilots failing to transition to the production stage.

This talk introduces Taipy, an open-source Python library for front-end and back-end development. It enables Data Scientists and Python Developers to create pilots and production-ready applications for end-users.

Its syntax facilitates the creation of interactive, customizable, and multi-page dashboards with augmented Markdown. Without the need for web development expertise (no CSS or HTML), users can generate highly interactive interfaces. 

Additionally, Taipy is engineered to construct robust and tailored data-driven back-end applications. Intuitive components like pipelines and data flow orchestration empower users to organize and manage data effectively. Taipy also introduces a unique Scenario Management functionality, facilitating "what-if" analysis for data scientists and end-users.
