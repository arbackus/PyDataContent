## Abstract
Existing book recommendation systems like Goodreads are based on correlating the reading habits of people. But what if you want a humorous book? Or a book that is set in 19th century Paris? Or a thriller, but without violence? 
We build book recommendation systems for Dutch libraries based on more than a dozen features from historical setting, to writing style, to main character characteristics. This allows us to tailor each recommendation to individual readers.
