## Abstract
How can you evaluate your production models when the data is not structured and you have no labels? To start, by tracking patterns and changes in the input data and model outputs. In this talk, I will give an overview of the possible approaches to monitor NLP and LLM models: from embedding drift detection to using regular expressions.
