## Abstract
In this talk, we discuss how we can use the python package PySTAN to estimate the Lifetime Value (LTV) of the users that can be acquired from a marketing campaign, and use this estimate to find the optimal bidding strategy when the LTV estimate itself has uncertainty. Throughout the presentation, we highlight the benefits from using Bayesian modeling to estimate LTV, and the potential pitfalls when forecasting LTV. By the end of the presentation, attendees will have a solid understanding of how to use PySTAN to estimate LTV,  optimize their marketing campaign bidding strategies, and implement the best Bayesian modelling solution.
