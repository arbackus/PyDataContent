## Abstract
The Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology is a popular causal inference method utilized by leading tech firms such as Microsoft Research, LinkedIn, Meta, and Uber. Yet recent studies suggest that traditional DiD methods may have significant limitations when treatment timings differ. An effective alternative is the implementation of the staggered DiD design. We exemplify this by investigating an interesting question in the music industry: Does featuring a song in TV shows influence its popularity, and are there specific factors that could moderate this impact?
